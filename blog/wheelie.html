    <h1>WHEELIE</h1>

    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Wheelie is a two-wheeled self-balancing robot. It is my first hardware project, which I started to get myself familiar with building robotics hardware, and the implementation of control theory.</p>
    <p>It is fundamentally an inverted pendulum with an actuator at the bottom, which is also known as a cart-pole. The aim is for the actuator to keep the inverted pendulum perfectly vertical which is a control problem.</p>
    <h3>1.1. Components of Wheelie: Sensors</h3>
    <p>In order to &quot;control&quot; the orientation of the robot, you will need to be able to know the orientation in the first place - that&apos;s where the sensors come in. </p>
    <p>There are different devices which sense different things, and there are different ways to use those things to get the orientation. </p>

    <div><b>Gyroscopes</b></div>
    <p>One way is to use a gyroscope which senses the angular velocity in the body frame. You could integrate this to get the angular orientation, but there a problem with this approach: drift.</p>
    <p>If you leave a robot at rest for a period of time, you will expect the measured orientation to remain constant because it is at rest, but when integrating gyroscope measurements to get angular orientation, you’ll notice the measured orientation keeps gradually increasing even when the robot is at rest. The phenomenon is gyroscope drift.</p>
    <p>There’s a bunch of reason why drift occurs.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>There is a bias error in the angular velocity measured from the gyroscope. If the robot is at rest, you’ll expect the angular velocity to be 0, but the measured value from the gyroscope would likely be non-zero. This occurs because... reason. Anyways, this can be easily fixed/greatly reduced by calibrating the gyroscope.</li>
    <li>Also, you’d expect there to be noise in the measurements from the gyroscope. Normally you’ll expect the mean to be 0 since it is white noise, but that doesn’t actually happen, you’ll expect random walks (idk wtf I’m talking about)</li>
    <li>etc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, all these stuff causes drift in gyroscopes, are there better alternatives?</p>

    <div><b>Accelerometers</b></div>
    <p>Another way we can estimate orientation is to use a device called an accelerometer. An accelerometer measures the linear acceleration in the body frame.</p>
    <p>Thanks to maths, there’s a random equation you can use to estimate the orientation from the acceleration measurements.</p>
    <p>A benefit of using an accelerometer to measure orientation is that it doesn’t have drift like a gyroscope. Great! We now have an error free way of measuring orient- not so fast! Although an accelerometer doesn’t have drift like a gyroscope, it has a very big noise problem. The estimated orientation would have a lot of noise. </p>
    <p>Okay accelerometers are no good either. Is there any hope for a common man who just want make robot go brr?</p>

    <div><b>Sensor Fusion</b></div>
    <p>Yes, yes there is still hope. Let&apos;s revisit the last two sensors. Gyroscopes give inaccurate measurements in the long term due to drift, but relatively accurate measurements in the short term. Accelerometers give inaccurate measurements in the short terms because they are very susceptible to noise, but in the long term, they should give relatively accurate measurements since the mean effect of the noise should be zero. Imagine if we could take advantage of this disparity and use gyroscopes measurements in the short term, while switching to accelerometers in the long term?</p>
    <p>That&apos;s called sensor fusion. A more technical way of understanding sensor fusion is to think of the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements in terms of the frequency response. For the gyroscope, the drift changes very slowly, so the drift error occurs at low frequencies. For the accelerometer, the noise usually changes very fast, so that would occur at high frequencies. Imagine if we take a low pass filter for the accelerometer to remove the high frequency noise, and take a high pass filter for the gyroscope to get rid of the low frequency drift, and add the resulting signals. That would give a relatively good measurement of orientation.</p>
    <p>That&apos;s basically the gist of sensor fusion. There are different ways of doing sensor fusion: complementary filters, Kalman filters etc. The best filter to use depends on your use-case really. But Kalman filters are probably objectively the best way, since they are the optimal way of doing it. Optimal in the sense that a Kalman filter minimizes the error between output reading and the actual reading.</p>

    <h3>1.2.	Components of Wheelie: Actuator</h3>
    <p>Once you know the orientation of the robot, you&apos;ll need something to correct the orientation if it is straying for the desired one.</p>
    <p>A typical way to do this is to use a motor. But there are different types of motors which their different strengths.</p>
    <p>Brushed motors, Brushless motors, Servo motors (basically same as first two, but with closed loop feedback), stepper motors.</p>

    <h3>1.3.	Components of Wheelie: Controller</h3>
    <p>This the brain of the system. It coordinates everything required for the robot to work. It coordinates taking measurements from the sensors, calculating the desired command to give to the actuators, and other important stuff.</p>

    <h2>2.	BUILDING WHEELIE</h2>
    <h3>2.0. Hardware setup</h3>
    <p><b>Wheelie v1 Setup</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller</li>
        <li>MPU 6050 6-axis IMU</li>
        <li>Two brushed motors with geared wheels from a robotics kit</li>
        <li>L298N motor driver</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.1. Sensing Orientation with the MPU6050</h3>
    <h4>2.1.1 Overview of the MPU6050</h4>
    <p>MPU6050 is a 6-axis IMU made by Invensense. It comes with an accelerometer, gyroscope, and a Digital Motion Processor which is able to combine the data from the two sensors to estimate the orientation in quaternion form.</p>
    <p>It communicates through I<sup>2</sup>C, and has the option of connecting an external 3-axis magnetometer to provide 9-axis output.</p>
    <p>The onboard gyroscope comes with user programmable precision of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and ±2000 °/sec, and the accelerometer with precision of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, and ±16g </p>

    </figure>
    <span class="todo">#TODO add schematic of setup</span>


    <h4>2.1.2 Reading measurements from the mpu6050</h4>
    <p>Each register on the sensor is 1 byte and can be written or read to through I<sup>2</sup>C. Each of the 6 measurements from both the accelerometer and gyroscope are 16 bit and are stored on 2 registers each.</p> 
    <p>For example, to get the current accelerometer reading on the x-axis, you&apos;ll need to get the high byte at address 0x3B and the low byte at 0x3C. An excerpt of the datasheet is shown below.</p>

    </figure>

    <h4>2.1.3 Hello MPU 6050?</h4>
    <p>I tested if the mpu 6050 was working, but the arduino wasn&apos;t finding it</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/img/whelie_first_try.jpg" alt="initial code" style="width: 100%;">
        <figcaption>I2C device not found</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>After searching the internet, found that the solution was to solder the headers to the MPU 6050</p>
    <p>This fixed the problem, and I could finally read measurements from the MPU 6050.</p>
    <figure>

        <figcaption>Soldered MPU 6050</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h4>2.1.4 Switching to a library</h4>
    <p>Initially, I wrote the drivers for the mpu 6050 myself, but I wanted to make use of the Digital Motion Processor to automatically calculate angles, instead of writing something like a kalman filter myself.</p>
    <p>The problem is that the DMP features aren&apos;t documented, and are only really accessible through Invensense&apos;s proprietary software, so I made use of <a href="http://www.i2cdevlib.com/devices/mpu6050#source">a popular library</a> that had already done all of the work of reverse engineering Invensense&apos;s software</p>

    <h4>2.1.5 New Setup</h4>
    <p>I changed the setup to make use of interrupts</p>
    <span class="todo">#TODO add schematic for setup</span>
    <p>Here are some measurements I was able to take.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/img/mpu6050_readings_1.png" alt="sample mpu 6050 readings" style="width: 100%;">
        <figcaption>Sample mpu 6050 readings</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Also, after much trouble trying to get matplotlib GUI to work in wsl, I was able to write a cool python script to plot the measurements from the MPU 6050 in realtime</p>
    <span class="todo">#TODO add video </span>

    <h4>2.1.6 Problem #1: I2C hanging</h4>
    <p>I noticed after a few minutes, I stopped recieving serial outputs from the arduino.</p>
    <p>I tried some fixes I found from searching forums, github issues etc.. none of them worked </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Increased the sample rate from 9600 to 38400 buads</li>
        <li>Checked if there were problems with fifo buffer overflow on the mpu 6050</li>
        <li>Grounding AD0 pin</li>
        <li>Adding a timeout on arduino with <code>Wire.setWireTimeout(3000, true);</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Suprisingly, once I reduced the sample rate back to 9800, the problem disappeared</p>
    <span class="todo"># TODO new setup</span>

    <h4>2.1.7 Problem #2: Random spikes</h4>
    <p>I also noticed there were random large spikes in the readings from the accelerometer and gyroscope when I left it at rest for a while.</p>
    <figure>

        <figcaption>Spikes from gyroscope (bottom) and accelerometer (top)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For the accelerometer, I noticed there was a lot of noise on the x-axis measurements and a bunch of small spikes, but for the y, and z axis, the was less noise, but larger spikes</p>

    </figure>
    <p>For the gyroscope, there wasn&apos;t much noise or spikes on the x-axis, but the spikes on the y axis were all in the ±250+ range, and the z axis spikes were all 255 or -258...</p>
